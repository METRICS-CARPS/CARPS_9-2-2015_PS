# Target Outcomes
## Article ID: 9-2-2015 PS

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in results section of Experiment 1a.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> On the presurprise trials, 89% of responses in the location
task were correct, which indicates that participants
could easily locate the target by using the critical attribute.
To analyze the data from the surprise trial, we first
divided participants into two groups defined by the order
of the surprise tasks (identity task first vs. color task first).
We found that the results were almost the same in these
two groups. Accordingly, we combined the data for these
groups in the analyses reported here. Only 6 of 20 (30%)
participants correctly reported the color of the target letter,
which is not much better than chance level of 25%
(because there were four choices). Furthermore, performance
on the identity task (25% correct) was exactly at
chance level. These results demonstrate that participants
were not capable of reporting a task-relevant attribute of
a stimulus that had reached awareness less than 1 s
before (i.e., attribute amnesia). Moreover, in the surprise
trial, participants’ performance on the location task,
unlike their performance on the color and identity tasks,
was good (80% correct), and in fact was approximately
as good as their performance on the location task in the
presurprise trials (89% correct). This indicates that the
poor performance on the color and identity tasks was not
induced by the surprise test itself; it more likely reflects
participants’ failure to remember these attributes.
Participants exhibited a dramatic increase in reporting
accuracy for the target letter’s color (70% correct) and
identity (75% correct) on the first control trial (i.e., the
trial immediately after the surprise trial). The improvement
in each case was significant—color: 70% versus
30%, χ2(1, N = 40) = 6.40, p = .011, ϕ = .40; identity: 75%
versus 25%, χ2(1, N = 40) = 10.00, p < .005, ϕ = .50.
Performance on these two tasks remained constant on
the final three control trials (color: 75%, 70%, and 80%
correct; identity: 75%, 80%, and 75% correct). Participants’
performance on the location task was almost the same
on the surprise trial (80% correct) as on the control trials
(80%, 85%, 80%, and 70% correct). These results indicate
a crucial role for expectation in controlling participants’
ability to report the attributes of a consciously perceived object. Therefore, Experiment 1a showed that when participants
did not expect to report a particular attribute of
an attended object, they were incapable of doing so,
even when that same attribute had reached awareness
immediately prior to the test.
